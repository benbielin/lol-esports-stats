# League of Legends Esports Statistics

Like many people, I wasted my youth playing too much League of Legends. I was not particularly skilled at the game, considering I only reached a peak rank of Gold 4 in Season 2020. I was never able to fully grasp the concepts surrounding the game, and this made it incredibly difficult to increase my rank.

As such, I was always fascinated by the elite of the elite; that is, the professional players who played this game at an extremely high level. These esports athletes were quite literally one in a million.

Being a bit of a numbers guy, I began to take interest in the statistics of these players. There are plenty of amazing websites that have compiled the statistics of these esports athletes. However, the data was often incomplete. This was often because some tournaments simply were not recorded or were recorded with incomplete data.

One thing I wanted to find but had difficulty finding was the match history for specific players. That is initially what led me to start this project. I wanted to view Faker's comphrensive pro League of Legends match history, but was unable to find a complete list anywhere. So I decided I would scrape the web to see if I could compile this list myself.

# Players' Statistics and Data Visualization

The first part of this project is compiling statistics and turning them into cool-looking visualizations.

## Faker

Faker is almost unanimously recognized as the greatest of all time (GOAT). His match history was the first one which I tried to compile.

## Jankos

Jankos is one of the greatest of all time. He has many great games and his funny personality makes him an interesting media figure. Also, he also has an extensive match history, which, I'll be honest, contributed to my choosing his stats to compile and visualize.

# Machine Learning

The second part of this project involves predicting game outcomes using machine learning tools. The tools I used are Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.

## Predicting Game Outcome Based On Players

Sometimes, we don't even have to look at a game to know who won. (Unless it's G2 vs one of the rebuilding teams). But what if two teams are evenly matched on paper? Can we build a model that can predict the outcome of this game?

## Predicting Game Outcome Based On Players AND Draft

Draft is fun, right? But does it actually matter?
