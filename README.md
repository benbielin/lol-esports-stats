# League of Legends Esports Statistics

Like many people, I wasted my youth playing too much League of Legends. I was not particularly skilled at the game, considering I only reached a peak rank of Gold 4 in Season 2020. I was never able to fully grasp the concepts surrounding the game, and this made it incredibly difficult to increase my rank.

As such, I was always fascinated by the elite of the elite; that is, the professional players who played this game at an extremely high level. These esports athletes were quite literally one in a million.

Being a bit of a numbers guy, I began to take interest in the statistics of these players. There are plenty of amazing websites that have compiled the statistics of these esports athletes. However, the data was often incomplete. This was often because some tournaments simply were not recorded or were recorded with incomplete data.

One thing I wanted to find but had difficulty finding was the match history for specific players. That is initially what led me to start this project. I wanted to view Faker's comphrensive pro League of Legends match history, but was unable to find a complete list anywhere. So I decided I would scrape the web to see if I could compile this list myself.

## Faker

Faker is almost unanimously recognized as the greatest of all time (GOAT). His match history was the first one which I tried to compile.
