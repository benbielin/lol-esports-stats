There is no website I've found that just shows Faker's (or anyone elses) complete match history. Thus, I have to scrape from multiple tables and use a lot of dataframe joining to get the match history. It's not complete but I will have to do. There must be a way to piece together the information.\n","\n","What I can do is get a list of tournaments Faker played in, then go to each of those tournaments, scrape the match history from those tournaments, and only look for Faker's games.\n","\n","Actually, now that I think about it, I probably want to start by scraping the match history from every tournament ever. This way, I can filter the match history for certain teams and players so that things will be slightly easier in the future.\n","\n","I plan to work on this a little bit every day. It may take a few years, but this seems like it'll be an interesting project."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"b35db2a3","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.047741,"end_time":"2022-09-29T06:11:19.171415","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-09-29T06:11:19.123674","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["Also, a lot of missing data.
